# risch
Transcendental &amp; Parallel Risch Algorithm

I hacked this implementation of the Risch algorithm together as part of my honours project at Monash University in 2006. If I was doing this again now I would probably do a lot of things differently. However, it served its purpose and worked relatively well. I acknowledge the excellent book Symbolic Integration 1 by Manuel Bronstein for guiding this implementation. I have no doubt his implementation in AXIOM was and still is the best Risch implementation in existance. 

I probably coded this up in version 5, I have no idea how it will go with later versions of mathematica.
